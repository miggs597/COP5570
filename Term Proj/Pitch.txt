## Project Proposal 

I would like to develop a GUI torrent streaming application that targets
Linux, Windows, and macOS x86. The only torrents that this will be useful 
for are of course films, and or shows.

I believe this project will showcase concurrent, and network programing. 


The GUI will be made with Compose for Desktop, thanks to targeting the JVM
I will be able to run this program wherever there's a JRE. I should also be
able to use libtorrent4j for handeling the torrents.
